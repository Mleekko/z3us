# Migrate accounts for Babylon Network Upgrade

## Introduction

We are committed to delivering an enhanced Radix DLT experience, and we appreciate your patience and support as we embark on this exciting journey. In our continuous pursuit of innovation, we are pleased to announce the forthcoming network update. However, we want to clarify some important details regarding the transition.

At the time of the network update, the Z3US wallet will not be immediately compatible with the new network version. Rest assured, an update for the Z3US wallet is on the horizon and will follow shortly. During this interim period, if you wish to access your accounts seamlessly, you have the option to migrate them from Z3US to the Radix Mobile Wallet. We understand the value of your accounts, and this transition process ensures their accessibility without delay.

It's worth noting that the Z3US wallet update is in the pipeline and will be released shortly. If you wish to continue using the accounts you already have, do not delete the Z3US wallet extension. Deleting the extension will result in the loss of all associated data and will require you later to restore your accounts one by one.

We are excited to announce that wallet updates will be introduced progressively, unlocking a host of new features within the Z3US wallet. We are committed to providing a comprehensive and user-friendly experience, and these updates will play a vital role in achieving that goal.

Furthermore, we will soon unveil a detailed roadmap outlining each step of the Z3US wallet updates. This roadmap will provide transparency and insight into the evolution of the wallet, ensuring you are well-informed about the enhancements and features coming your way.

Thank you for your continued trust and support as we work diligently to deliver an enhanced Radix DLT experience. Your accounts are important to us, and we are dedicated to ensuring a smooth and secure transition to the Babylon network upgrade. Please follow the instructions in this document carefully to make the most of this exciting transition.

### Prerequisites

Before embarking on the migration process, it is imperative to ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

Radix Mobile Wallet Installed: Confirm that you have successfully installed the Radix Mobile Wallet on your iOS or Android mobile device. This pivotal tool will facilitate the smooth transition of your accounts.
Access to Your Z3US Wallet: Ensure that you have ready access to your Z3US wallet and the specific account(s) you intend to migrate. Your Z3US wallet will serve as the point of origin for this migration.
Ledger Hardware Device (For Ledger Users): If you are a user of a Ledger hardware device, ensure that your Ledger device is securely connected to your computer. This step is particularly crucial for those who rely on Ledger hardware devices to access their accounts.
Throughout the migration process, it is essential to closely follow the Radix Mobile Wallet instructions provided. These instructions will serve as your guiding light, ensuring a seamless and secure transition of your accounts to the Babylon network upgrade.
