# Migrate accounts for Babylon Network Upgrade

We are dedicated to enhancing the Radix DLT experience and value your support during this journey. We are excited to announce an upcoming network update. Here are key points:

- Z3US Wallet Compatibility: After the network update, the Z3US wallet will not immediately work with the new version. However, we have an upcoming Z3US wallet update that will ensure compatibility.
- Account Access: During this interim period, you can seamlessly migrate your accounts from Z3US to the Radix Mobile Wallet to ensure uninterrupted access.
- Preservation of Data: If you want to retain your existing accounts, please do not delete the Z3US wallet extension. Deleting it will result in the loss of associated data from within the extension.

Stay tuned for a comprehensive roadmap outlining the upcoming Z3US wallet updates, providing transparency and insight into the evolution of the wallet.

Thank you for your trust and support as we work diligently to improve the Radix DLT experience. We are committed to a smooth and secure transition to the Babylon network upgrade. For migration instructions, please read below:

### Prerequisites

Before embarking on the migration process, it is imperative to ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

Access to Your Z3US Wallet: Ensure that you have ready access to your Z3US wallet and the specific account(s) you intend to migrate. Your Z3US wallet will serve as the point of origin for this migration.
Ledger Hardware Device (For Ledger Users): If you are a user of a Ledger hardware device, ensure that your Ledger device is securely connected to your computer. This step is particularly crucial for those who rely on Ledger hardware devices to access their accounts.
Throughout the migration process, it is essential to closely follow the Radix Mobile Wallet instructions provided. These instructions will serve as your guiding light, ensuring a seamless and secure transition of your accounts to the Babylon network upgrade.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully migrated your wallet to the Babylon network upgrade. Your accounts and assets should now be accessible in the upgraded Radix Mobile Wallet. Make sure to securely store your seed phrase and any other sensitive information related to your wallet.

In the event that you encounter any impediments impeding the seamless progression of your migration endeavor, fret not, for an alternative avenue awaits your exploration. You have the option to export your seed and initiate the migration process from within the confines of Radix Olympia's desktop wallet, which shall serve as a sanctuary for the uninterrupted continuation of your migration journey. A similar recourse is available for those entrusting their assets to Ledger devices, ensuring that no obstacle shall deter your quest for successful migration.

Moreover, should the Z3US extension falter in its endeavor to autonomously initiate the migration user interface during the pivotal moment of network update, rest assured that an astute contingency plan is firmly in place. In such circumstances, we shall seamlessly pivot towards manual release procedures, ensuring that the migration process proceeds with unyielding momentum. During this brief interim period, we recommend that you avail yourself of the aforementioned seed exportation and migration initiation via the Radix Olympia desktop wallet, thus maintaining the steadfast pursuit of your migration objectives.

However, should any uncertainties or complexities arise throughout this intricate process, do not hesitate to seek recourse to Radix's official support resources or directly engage their adept support team for expert guidance and resolution. Your journey towards seamless migration remains paramount, and their support shall serve as an invaluable beacon illuminating the path to your desired destination.
