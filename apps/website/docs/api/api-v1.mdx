# API V1




## V1

Provider API is promise based, and user is expected to catch and handle errors, promises will resolve whenever possible or timeout after 3 minutes. Including confirmation window.

```js
declare global {
	interface Window {
		z3us: {
			v1: {
				hasWallet: () => Promise<boolean>
				isConnected: () => Promise<boolean>
				connect: () => Promise<string>
				disconnect: () => Promise<void>
				sign: (challenge: string) => Promise<string>
				submitTransaction: (payload: { transaction: any }) => Promise<any>
				encrypt: (message: string, fromAddress: string, toAddress: string) => Promise<string>
				decrypt: (message: string, fromAddress: string) => Promise<string>
				addresses: () => Promise<string[]>
				balances: () => Promise<unknown>
				stakes: () => Promise<unknown>
				unstakes: () => Promise<unknown>
				/**
				* @deprecated Use submitTransaction() instead
				*/
				sendTransaction: (payload: { symbol: string; fromAddress: string; transaction: any }) => Promise<any>
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Error handling

To handle errors in a simple manner, use `try/catch` block, function will throw in case of action declined or unexpected error. There is a 3 minute timeout on the promise.


```js
try {
	const response = await window.z3us.v1.balances()
} catch (error) {
	console.error(error)
}
```

## Connecting

Prior to connecting, please verify that `window.z3us` is available and that user has initialised their wallet. To connect use window.z3us.v1.connect() which will return the currently selected address.


```js
const hasWallet = await window.z3us?.v1.hasWallet()
if (!hasWallet) {
	return
}
const selectedAddress = await window.z3us.v1.connect()
```


Once the user authorises your website, the extension popup will not show again (unless they remove the permissions) and the `connect` method will return the selected address.

## Disconnecting

Your website might be disconnected by the user, or you can call _disconnect_ method, which will trigger extension popup again next time you call connect.


```js
await window.z3us.v1.disconnect()
```

[Z3US](https://z3us.com) injects a global API into websites visited by its users at `window.z3us`. This API allows users to interact with wallet and [Radix DLT](https://www.radixdlt.com/).
